  description: "My name is Bhargavram Pedgaonkar. I am an enthusiastic and dedicated Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering student with a strong interest in Embedded Systems, IoT, and Control Engineering. I am a quick learner with a self-driven attitude and enjoy exploring how hardware and software can work together to solve real-world problems.I work with microcontrollers, sensors, MATLAB/Simulink, and embedded C, and I’m passionate about building intelligent systems for automation, detection, and control. Through my projects, I have developed strong problem-solving abilities, along with the habit of writing clear technical documentation and managing tasks efficiently.I also demonstrated team leadership during my Sports Awareness Initiative, where I coordinated interviews with coaches, players, and sports personalities, built a website, and proposed solutions to real challenges in grassroots sports. These experiences strengthened my communication and presentation skills as well as my beginner-level project management abilities.I am open to opportunities in Embedded Systems, IoT Development, Electronics Engineering, and Control Systems, where I can apply and grow my skills further",
